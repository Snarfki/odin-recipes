        <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>Fantabulous colored, bite-sized macaroons. Divide batter into thirds; color one portion pink and flavor with raspberry, another yellow with lemon flavoring, 
            <br> and the remaining pale blue with vanilla flavoring. Fill and make sandwich cookies with filling of choice, like peach jam or strawberry preserves.</p>
            
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 egg whites</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons superfine (castor) sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup almond meal</li>
                <li>1 1/3 cups confectioners's sugar</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone mat.</li>
                <li>Whisk egg whites in a clean metal mixing bowl until thick, about 5 minutes. Whisk superfine sugar into egg whites until thick, glossy, and stiff peaks form, 5 to 8 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Sift almond meal and confectioners' sugar over beaten egg whites; gently fold in, retaining as much air as possible.</li>
                <li>Divide meringue into separate bowls to flavor and color, if desired.</li>
                <li>Spoon meringue into a piping bag fitted with a 3/8-inch tip. Pipe 1-inch disks of meringue onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between cookies.</li>
                <li>Let cookies stand at room temperature to form a thin skin, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Lift the baking sheets; let drop from several inches above the work surface to adhere cookies to the baking sheets.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are dry, about 15 minutes; let cool completely on the baking sheets before peeling off the parchment paper, about 45 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
