        <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>he Moscow Mule practically crackles from its chill. Stuff your nose into the cup before you sip, 
                and the gingery aroma will shoot up into your brain stem, 
                cutting into the haze of your groggy mind like the edge of a Siberian glacier. 
                Cough if you must. Then, it's time to sip.</p>
