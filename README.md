# odin-recipes
This project will be one of my first HTML projects. this project will allow me showcase my HTML knowledge and understanding based from what I learned under the odin project.

I had little background about HTML before joining the odin project, but after finishing the HTML Foundations, I can now structure a website properly with correct directories making it easy for me to navigate my files. Now, I can also create a HTML Boilerplate from the back of my head, without referring to my notes.

Here is the boiler plate that I use:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title></title>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>
